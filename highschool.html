      <p>This is the high school where I did most of my secondary school academic years.</p>
      <p>It is located in Kribi II, just in front of the beach. Unfortunately, in the last 4 years it has recorded more than 15 student deaths, some of which were my friends and people I knew.</p>
      <p>One of them died just last year along with three of his friends I had seen the day before. I was like "It is not possible". But even with all the challenges, my years in this school were overall fun and inspiring.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:center;">College Adventiste Bilingue de Kribi</h3>

      <p>When I arrived there, it was very different. Normal, it was the first time I was changing school.</p>
      <p>It was smaller, more expensive, with less quality but could drive a student for 100 f. The teachers were slow, not well paid, and regularly absent. I just wanted to leave this school.</p>
